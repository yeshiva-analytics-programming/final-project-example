    "# Obtaining NYC 311 Data\n",
    "\n",
    "New York's Open Data Portal (https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) uses the Socrata Open Data API to give API access to data hosted on the site.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is significant because the datasets on NYC Open Data are often many millions of rows -- prohibitively large for some.  It's helpful to be able to download only the first, say, 50 thousand rows to get a taste of what the entire dataset is.  We can also specify only certain data, using column names and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 311 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In the city of New York, citizens with non-emergency complaints (e.g. trash non-collection, rodent infestations) can call 311 to make a Service Request. These are recorded and shared on New York's open data site at https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-Level Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The data dates from 2010 to the current day, with data being updated on a daily basis. At the time of this writing, there are over 20 million rows, each row representing a single service request, and over 40 columns which represent aspects of each service request, such as the street address being referenced, the type of complaint, the agency responsible, the date of the service request, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bring in Data via pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "We're only going to bring in only the rows that have 'Pothole' in the descriptor field.  We'll set an upper limit of 1 million rows."
